## Hi there 👋  

I’m **Alejandro Dorado**, a Senior Computer Science student at the University of North Florida (Dec 2025).  
I build secure, user-centric software, machine learning solutions, and experiment in security operations.  

If an idea pops into my head, I’ll design it, code it, and ship it.  
My tech stack includes **Python · Java · JavaScript · React · Django · MySQL · Splunk · Linux · Networking**.  
Currently, I’m working on SOC lab setups, incident-response workflows, and full-stack apps with ML components.  

📫 Reach out via [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alejandrodorado) or [GitHub](https://github.com/AlejandroDoradoP2002)  
🌱 Open to full-time roles in Security Engineering, Software Development & AI/ML Ops (OPT-ready Feb 2026)  
😄 Fun Fact: I support 900+ students each semester as a Programming Assistant and love turning coffee into secure code.
